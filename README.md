# Welcome to my Learning Journey

This repo tracks my self-education progress in IT, Networking, and Cybersecurity.

## What's Inside
- HTB Lab write-ups
- HTB Academy notes
- Concepts I'm studying (curl, FTP, HTTP, networking basics)

I'll keep updating this as I learn.

## How I Use AI

AI helps me speed up learning, clarify concepts, and perform basic grammar checks (for speed, yes I could do it myself). None of my documents or files are AI generated, feel free to check my daily commits.
