# My Learning Journey

This repo tracks my progress in IT, Networking, and Cybersecurity.

## What's Inside
- HTB Lab write-ups
- HTB Academy notes
- Concepts I'm studying (curl, FTP, HTTP, networking basics)

I'll keep updating this as I learn.

## How I Use AI

AI helps me speed up learning, clarify concepts, and explore topics deeper.  
I don't use it to bypass skills—just to understand things better and ask better questions.
